# An authentication system in vanilla PHP.(Under Development) To run this u need to install PHP in ur system. U can download and install xammp that contains a local server and mysql database. Its implemented using the MVC pattern and with ORM like design.
All necessary checks are made in server side.

First u need to put your own credentials for your server and database in Credentials.php
After that just run the Register2.php and a non style form will appear.
